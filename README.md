## Unit 1: Get started

### Lesson 1: Build your first app

1. HelloWorld project

A simple app displayed "Hello World" to verify that Android Studio is correctly installed, and to learn the basics of developing with Android Studio.

2. HelloToast project

The HelloToast consisted of two `Button` elements and one `TextView`. When the user taps the first `Button`, it displays a short message (a `Toast`) on the screen. Tapping the second `Button` increases a "click" counter displayed in the `TextView`, which starts at zero.

This app changed default launcher icon.

3. MyApplication project

MyApplication was based on `Basic Activity` template. The `Basic Activity` template has more features and incorporates recommended app features, such as the options menu that appears in the app bar on Android-powered devices.

### Lesson 2: Activities and intents

4. TwoActivities project

TwoActivities contained two `Activity` implementations. You can send data from the main `Activity` to the second `Activity` and return data back to the main `Activity`.

5. TwoActivities (lifecycle) project

This project modified the existing TwoActivities project and added implementations of the `Activity` lifecycle callback methods to print messages to **logcat** when those methods are invoked.
